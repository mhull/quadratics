# Quadratic Equation Solver

This is a plain-looking HTML form where you can get the solution to any quadratic equation in the form <code>ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0</code>.

[In the demo](https://mhull.github.io/quadratics/), you can provide the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` and it will tell you the solution(s) for `x` if it exists.

The solution itself is worked out in the `quadratic.js` file.
